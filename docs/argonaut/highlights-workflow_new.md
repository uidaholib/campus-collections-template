# Argonaut highlights

The front page of the Argonaut digital collection features a randomly generated "front page" made of snippets from Argo issues through the years.
This provides an engaging entry point to scan the weird and interesting contents of Argonaut and invite people to explore.
Users can click on a highlight to visit the related Argonaut issue.

Take a look at the current home page for examples,

## Choosing highlights

While working on metadata for Argonaut issues you will be scanning the contents of each PDF.
If you find a story, headline, ad, or image that is particularly interesting, you can create a highlight to be added to the front page feature.
Think about snippets that are:

- representative of the era (e.g. the common ads from the 1950s)
- represents important university events, places, history, or figures (e.g. fire in admin building)
- reflects important international events/news (e.g. student to WWII)
- fun, weird, wacky, and/or unexpected 
 
We aim to have a handful of highlights from each year over all. 
Every issue does not need a highlight.

## Create a highlight

Use Window's Snipping Tool to grab a screen shot of the highlight. 
Use the Rectangular Snip option to create an image close cropped to the highlight content. 

Save the screenshot as a PNG following this naming convention:

`objectid_size_title.png`

Where:

- objectid = the ID of the PDF you captured it from (this follows the pattern arg-yyyy-mm-ddm and can be found in the link to the PDF or PDF filename)
- size = use sm, md, lg, xl to indicate the number of columns the highlight should take up in the web page display (horizontal width). 
    - sm is 1 column (~25% of the news page)
    - md is 2 columns (a medium image, two column article, or ad, etc)
    - lg is 3 columns (a large image or add, etc)
    - xl is 4 columns (typically a headline that crosses the full page width)
- title = a short single word to make your filename unique. Do not use spaces or weird characters. e.g. "frogs", "play", "cigs".

Each name part is separated by an underscore (`_`).

Examples:

- "arg-1913-10-16_md_football.png" might be a picture of the football team from the front page of https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/utils/getfile/collection/argonaut/id/1071/filename/arg-1913-10-16.pdf
- "arg-1985-10-11_sm_jacket.png" might be an ad for "Miami Vice jacket" found on page 11 of https://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/utils/getfile/collection/argonaut/id/9411/filename/ARG-1985-10-11.pdf
