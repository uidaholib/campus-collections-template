## About the Campus Artwork Collection

The Campus Artwork Collection presents a basic catalog of artworks owned by the University of Idaho, including paintings, sculptures, and prints from a variety of artists.
The collection spans over 500 years and includes location information. 
Many of the works are publicly accessible for viewing on campus.

Please note that the images in this collection are very basic photographs taken for inventory purposes. 
They are not intended as high quality digital representations, but only as a reference preview for the original objects.

This collection does not include the art held by University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives.
