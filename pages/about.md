The Women's Center on the University of Idaho's campus served to promote gender equity in the community as well as provide opportunities to support, educate, and support individuals. 

In 1972, University President Ernest Hartung appointed a small committee to address the high female student drop-out rate which led to the creation of the Women's Center. The committee soon expanded their focus to address other campus issues involving faculty and staff. 

After formal complaints were filed against the University and the following conciliatory agreement, the committee brought much-needed change to the University including an Affirmative Action plan, equal starting salaries, recruitment programs for female students, and more. 

Initially started as a volunteer organization, the Women's Center transformed into a fully staffed entity on campus that worked to promote and advocate for gender equality for the U of I community.

The Women's Center's last location was on the ground floor of the Memorial Gym, room 109, where it provided amenities open to anyone, including lounge areas, kitchenettes, study rooms and a variety of audio and visual materials about the social justice work being done surrounding the fight for female equity.

On Dec. 18, 2024 it was announced that the University of Idaho officially closed six of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion offices including the Women's Center. This was a result of the December 2024 Idaho State Board of Education Board Resolution on DEI Ideology in Higher Education which stated that "institutions shall ensure that no student resource or student success center serves students based on DEI ideology." The closings were completed by the start of the Spring 2025 semester.
