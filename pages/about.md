## About Special Collections

Head Librarian, Mary Belle Sweet, first brought up the notion of a 'special collection' in September 1933. In a letter she designated part of an old, unused elevator shaft and it was made into a small room with shelves. She saw the need to protect from environmental injury and theft any books that were deemed rare, valuable, unique, or for any reason should be treated with care.

Today, Special Collections and Archives specializes in the acquisition, preservation, and use of research materials that document the cultural and environmental history of Idaho, the University of Idaho, and to a lesser degree that of surrounding states. The collections include personal papers of individuals and families; business archives of lumber, railroad, mining, and other companies; Idaho state publications; papers of government officials, educators, authors, and business people; records of organizations such as religious, fraternal, civic, and environmental associations; and similar groups. The collection formats include personal papers and archives, photographs, books, serials, reports, maps, blueprints, oral history interviews, and related items.
