## How to Use Web Archives 

The majority of content captured by University of Idaho Library's web archiving efforts are contributed to [Internet Archive (IA)](https://archive.org/) and are discoverable using their [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) service.
IA has been archiving web content at a huge scale since 1996--the size of their holdings are hard to imagine, with *hundreds of billions* of web pages captured and *over 99* petabytes of data stored.

This makes IA a invaluable resource for [Finding Broken Links](#find-broken-links), [Saving a Web Page](#archive-a-web-page), and [Citing Sources](#citing-web-archives).

## Find Broken Links
{:.mt-5}

The IA's vast web content is accessible via the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).
Paste any URL into the search box to see past copies captured over time. 
To provide authentic access to archived web content, the Wayback Machine renders the original functionality in the user's web browser with links automatically redirected to archived sources rather than the live web.

[IA Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/){:.btn .btn-lg .btn-palouse .my-4}

- Copy the full URL for your broken link or a page you would like to see older versions.
- Paste the URL into the form on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) home page and click enter.
- If the page has been captured, you will be redirected to timeline view displaying the different times it has been captured allowing you to browse its history in the archive.

- Click on the timeline towards the top to navigate between different years.
- Hover over a date with a blue circle in the calendar below to display available snapshots, then click on one of the snapshot names.
- This will display an archived page captured at a specific date and time. Information about the capture is displayed in a box at the top.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/webarchive/uidaho2015.png" caption="uidaho.edu on 03-26-2015" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326020130/http://www.uidaho.edu/" %}

- The archived page can be shared by copying the full URL in your browser's address bar.
- Clicking on links inside the archived page will redirect to archived content at the same date if available.

## Archive a Web Page
{:.mt-5}

To build its collection, the Internet Archive continuously crawls huge sections of the web to archive content.
However, it also invites anyone to capture individual pages for free via its [Save Page Now](https://web.archive.org/save/) feature.
This is a form of curation, since if real people are interested in saving the content, it probably has more value than randomly crawled links.
Submissions are anonymous.

[IA Save Page Now](https://web.archive.org/save/){:.btn .btn-lg .btn-palouse .my-4}

- Copy the full URL for the web page you want to save from the address bar in your browser.
- Paste the URL into the form on [Save Page Now](https://web.archive.org/save/) and click "Save Page".
- The IA crawler will visit the live page and attempt to capture the data, which might take some time. Once complete, a success message will appear with a link to the archived content.
- Click the archive link. Copy the full URL from the address bar in your browser--this is your new permanent archive link.

For example, a recent Library website capture looks like:

`https://web.archive.org/web/20250824025821/https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/`

Optionally, you can [create an Internet Archive account](https://archive.org/account/signup).
When logged in, "Save Page Now" you will give you more advanced options, including save outlinks and screenshot.
If you select the option "Save also in my web archive", the capture will appear in your account's "web archive" list, giving you a basic way to keep track of saved items.

## Citing Web Archives
{:.mt-5}

Using web archive links in your citations helps ensure the evidence you reference does not disappear, maintaining the integrity of your scholarship *and* contributing important resources to web archives.

For example, the Law Library of Congress [started using Perma.cc as of Oct 2015](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/04/13/law-library-of-congress-implements-solution-for-link-and-reference-rot/) (<https://perma.cc/2AXT-2QKE>).
Citations in their documents, such as ["Regulation of Drones" (April 2016)](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/regulation-of-drones/index.php), now include archive links stored in Perma.cc like:

- ICAO, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Circular 328 AN/190 (2011), https://www.trafikstyrelsen.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/05%20Luftfart/Forum/UAS%20-%20droner/ICAO%20Circular%20328%20Unmanned%20Aircraft%20Systems%20UAS.ashx, archived at https://perma.cc/J5EM-TSAY. 
- CASA and Remotely Piloted Aircraft, CASA, https://www.casa.gov.au/aircraft/standard-page/casa-and-remotely-piloted-aircraft (last visited Apr. 4, 2016), archived at https://perma.cc/6NUC-HKK7.

If you are citing a live website, include the full normal citation, but add the archive link at the end:

- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)." *University of Idaho*, 21 Sept. 2020, www.uidaho.edu/vandal-health-clinic/coronavirus (archived at: https://perma.cc/T8YP-BFC9 ).
- Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg, Kasia. "Inside the Internet Archive". *The Atlantic*, 7 May 2013, www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/inside-the-internet-archive/466068/ (archived at: https://perma.cc/H3SK-LBR7 ). 

In some cases you will be citing a specific version of a page found in an web archive (rather than the current live page), saying something like "an earlier version of this story dated 2012 said..." or "in 2006 the web page reported...". 
In this situation you should make clear that you are citing the archived page, naming the web archive as the source of your citation.
Treat it as if you are citing the web archive site, rather than the original location.
Some style guides use "Retrieved from" to make this clear.

- "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)." *University of Idaho*, 23 May 2020. *Internet Archive*, web.archive.org/web/20200515231836/https://www.uidaho.edu/vandal-health-clinic/coronavirus.
- Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg, Kasia. "Inside the Internet Archive". *The Atlantic*, 7 May 2013. *Internet Archive*, web.archive.org/web/20160414123101/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/inside-the-internet-archive/466068/.

Keep in mind that most citation style guides inadequately describe how to handle citing web resources.
Few style guides mention the use of web archive links and some dictate not citing web pages at all.
However, it is better for ongoing scholarship to provide as much detail as possible for people to understand and find your evidence. 
It is often helpful to provide an "accessed on" date so that people will know *when* you are citing.
